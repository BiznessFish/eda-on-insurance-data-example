# Exploratory Data Analysis

This is a Lab assignment completed in the Data Science course at Johns Hopkins University. We take a set of data about insurance and conduct some EDA.

The data here was provided without context. The gist here was to focus on the process of EDA to see what kind of information and insights we can scrounge up.

Within the Jupyter Notebook, most every chart and statistic dervied from this graph is accompanied by a motivation and a discussion.
